# LiquidGraph

LiquidGraph is the implementation of my Master's Thesis at UC Berkeley. It's a combined A.I. and parametric simulation approach to the "workpiece draining" problem from manufacturing. In layman's terms, it rolls a ball out of a maze (intelligently).

## Demo

A demo of the algorithm can be seen [here](petercottle.com/liquidGraph/yc.html?demo), or you can go directly to the sandbox [here](petercottle.com/liquidGraph/index.html).

## Writeup

The full writeup (with all the gory details) will be available via my Master's Thesis, which is also on github [here](https://github.com/pcottle/MastersThesis).
