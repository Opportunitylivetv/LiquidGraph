Things To Do:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Part A: Refactor support for all particles:
------------------------------------------
* huge RESULTS refactor to keep track of all that stuff
* store multiple animations per node, build up multiple animations per node?
* animation with multiple particles (aka multiple rings, etc)

Part Epic #2:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Do the three scenarios:
1) if g_start is your minimum, you are good to go! dont do anything
2) if g_start and g_end are within your no motion zone, dont do anything
3) if its partway, figure out how much time to delay and other nasty shit

Part D: simulate multiple particles and keep track

Part E: update goal test :OOO

Part F: UI update

Misc:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* allow particles to just "delay" for a certain amount of ms before getting animated
* idea of the delay BEFORE kinetic path transition
