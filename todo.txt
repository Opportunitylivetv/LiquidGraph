Things To Do:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Part Epic #2:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Do the three scenarios:
2) if g_start and g_end are within your no motion zone, dont do anything
3) if its partway, figure out how much time to delay and other nasty shit

Part D: simulate multiple particles and keep track

Part E: update goal test :OOO

Part F: UI update

Misc:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* allow particles to just "delay" for a certain amount of ms before getting animated
* idea of the delay BEFORE kinetic path transition
