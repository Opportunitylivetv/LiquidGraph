Things To Do:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Part A: Refactor support for all particles:
------------------------------------------
* store multiple animations per node, build up multiple animations per node?
* animation with multiple particles (aka multiple rings, etc)

Part B: Refactor sampling:
------------------------------------------
* Based on arbitrary particle in arbitrary vertex with a beginning gmin and time
* Then calculate that time beforehand and limit it, allowing to pipe those into multiple

Part C: Reduce outward edge vectors to smallest pocket
-------------------------------------------
* this primes ability to sample multiple

Part D: simulate multiple particles and keep track

Part E: update goal test

Part F: UI update

Misc:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* allow particles to just "delay" for a certain amount of ms before getting animated
* idea of the delay BEFORE kinetic path transition
